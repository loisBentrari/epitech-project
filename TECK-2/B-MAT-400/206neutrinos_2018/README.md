# 206neutrinos

## Purpose

Considering the size of the series, 
develop a software that will allow him to update data in real-time. This program will take 4 numbers as inputs (the number of recorded values, their arithmetic mean, harmonic mean and standard deviation), and must:
1. wait for the next value to be written on the standard input,
2. print the number of recorded values, their standard deviation, arithmetic mean, root mean square
and harmonic mean,
3. return to the first step, except if the keyword END is entered.



## Usage
``` bash
./206neutrinos n a h sd
```

## DESCRIPTION
``` bash
n number of values
a arithmetic mean
h harmonic mean
sd standard deviation
```

## Result

|test-type| passed |
|--|--|
|1 - rigor | 100 % |
|2 - minimum tests | 100 % |
|3 - standard deviation | 100 % |
|4 - arithmetic mean | 100 % |
|5 - root mean square mean | 100 % |
|6 - harmonic mean | 100 % |

|Total| 100 % |
|--|--|
